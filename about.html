            Hey, I’m Thomas and i’m a Front-End Web Developer. I was born and raised here in Charlotte, NC
            I grew up like most people around my age with a controller in my hand and a computer in front of my face for more hours than I can even remember but I wouldn’t go back and change a minute. I’ve learned so much from those days because I always tried the newest thing whether that was making Call of Duty Videos with my friends and learning how to create 3D Text in Adobe After Effects the passion to create has always been a part of me, so when I discovered Web Development I was hooked from the beginning. The concept that you could think of pretty much think of anything any problem and in a few lines of code you could make it happen, bringing your idea into reality there’s nothing like it. So for the past year I’ve been full speed ahead learning anything and everything i can to improve my skills. I keep myself busy these days writing JavaScript and learning more and more about what you can do with Front-End Development.
