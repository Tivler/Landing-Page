            Hey, I’m Thomas and i’m a Front-End Web Developer. I was born and raised here in
            Charlotte,
            NC and i grew up like
            most people around my age with a controller in my
            hand
            and a computer in front of my face for more hours than I can even remember but I wouldn’t go back and change
            a
            minute.
            I’ve learned so much from those days because I always tried the newest thing whether that was making Call of
            Duty
            Videos with my friends and learning how to create 3D Text in Adobe After Effects the passion to create has
            always
            been
            a part of me, so when I discovered Web Development I was hooked from the beginning. The concept that you
            could think
            of
            pretty much think of anything any problem and in a few lines of code you could make it happen, bringing your
            idea
            into
            reality there’s nothing like it. So for the past year I’ve been full speed ahead learning anything and
            everything i
            can
            to improve my skills. I keep myself busy these days writing JavaScript and learning more and more about what
            you can
            do
            with Front-End Development.
