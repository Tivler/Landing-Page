				Hi, Im Thomas but around the internet I go by Tivler. Im pretty much into all things software and tech! From keyboards, monitors and desk setups to just being a nerd in general, I watch a lot of gaming streams and watch a ton of talks on all things software and spend majority of my time in front of a computer screen. Im very motivated and I love new things and new challenges that's probably why I chose web & software development. The concept that you could have any idea, any random thought or solve any little problem sometimes with just a few lines of code has completely changed the way I look at almost everything. Bringing ideas and thoughts to life there hasnâ€™t been anything that exciting since I first watched naruto! Today I keep myself busy working remote building customized and intuitive user experiences and learning more and more skills to add to my skill set everyday! - Tivler
